# Petite Performer

## Description

A searchable database for early childhood music classes in NYC

## Features

* queries the database based on location, age, and availablilty  
* returns results with or without params  
* sorts results by location (nearest to user's location)  

## Future

I would like to:  
* further seed the database or let schools sign in as users to update their classes themselves
* expand to dance and acting classes
