# Petite Performer

## Description

A searchable database for early childhood music classes in NYC

## Features

Users can:  
* log in through facebook  
* create a new ensemble  
* invite other users to their ensemble  
* add musical pieces to their ensemble  
* browse other users' ensembles  
* ask to join others' ensembles  
* search musicians and ensembles  
* message other users  

## Future

I would like to:  
* further seed the database or let schools sign in as users to update their classes themselves
* expand to dance and acting classes
